# Welcome to the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence <br> for High Schoolers Book!!!! üòÄ

Special Thanks to my friend & editor Aiden Choe

<ins>**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**</ins> is changing the landscape of multiple industries as we know it. In recent examples, AI has been used to save scientists an immense amount of time during the COVID-19 pandemic, producing a global impact. But what if **<ins>you</ins> could build your own AI** to do your homework, chores, or even just act as a personal companion when you are lonely?

This book is aimed towards **high schoolers** so that **you <ins>can</ins> begin** building your own AI. Most of the important concepts used in AI are based on calculus. **However**, calculus was built on algebra. As a result, this book brings any calculus concepts used in AI down to algebra, which is more familiar to high schoolers. 

## How can I trust your credibility as the author of this book? ü§®
1. I have successfully completed Coursera's Machine Learning Course from Stanford University's Stanford Online Program (certificate available for viewing [here](https://coursera.org/share/ad47e4264bf733454b1e37f968d10ebf).
2. I have already taken AP Calculus AB with an exam score of a 5 (with a solid understanding of calculus, I can easily bring calculus concepts used in AI down to algebra).
3. I am a high schooler so I know exactly which math concepts high schoolers know and which math concepts need to be brought down to algebra level.
4. This book is an open source format, meaning...its free! There is no fee to learn! Cancel your commitment anytime!

Details on the structure/format of the book on how to access and run the code is available here (tbd).

## About the Author's Journey in this Field of High Potential
I first got into AI because I thought it was unbelievable how you can give a machine an image and it will somehow recognize the type of object presented. The most impressive breakthrough that got me excited about this field was when a machine beat a human in the game Go. How could a machine, that spent considerably less time to learn the game, gain enough knowledge about its strategies to beat a champion? 

My father, who works with AI himself by programming robots, initiated my journey into AI and I still enjoy learning more complex AI and working on AI projects. 

After my sixth grade year he asked me if I wanted to make a website. It was very sudden, but I agreed because I would learn how the ‚Äúcool guys‚Äù (programmers) make websites with their coding skills. This wasn't related to AI, but that was the first time I dipped my feet into the field of computer science and started programming.  Later sometime during my junior-high years, I started learning Python. Though I quit the first time due to its difficulty, I pushed through the second time.

It was the summer of my freshman year at high school when my father suggested me to start a project on AI and self-driving cars was my number one pick. The problem was, I did not know anything about making AI and ended up going on Github to copy and paste other people‚Äôs work, hoping it would work for me. Unfortunately for me, it wasn't that simple, and I didn‚Äôt understand much of the README files and their steps,leading to several errors. 

Skip ahead a few weeks and I finally got one car to detect lane lines, but I didn‚Äôt feel that great; I didn‚Äôt understand what I did at all. It did not feel like a personal achievement, and I felt empty as if I cheated on a test to get an A. I felt no desire for celebration of my achievement because there was no hard work done by me. I took the shortcut that wouldn't offer long-term benefits.

Therefore, I decided to actually begin learning AI. On Coursera, I found an 11-week course on Machine Learning taught by Andrew Ng, former Stanford University Professor, which I enrolled in mid-August. The course was clearly meant for calculus students so I struggled with the equations, but I persevered; and now, it has brought me to where I am right now, writing a book for other high schoolers to help them understand AI without going through an online class with messy, confusing math equations. 

Hopefully you will enjoy this book to save yourself a lot of time in taking another step into the field of AI. I will try my best to convey the concepts in a different but relatable way to make understanding as easy as possible. Most importantly, I will bring calculus back down to the level of algebra (a high schooler‚Äôs math level). I hope you will enjoy this book! Thank you for reading.
