# Welcome to the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence <br> for High Schoolers Book!!!! üòÄ

Special Thanks to my co-author/editor: Aiden Choe

<ins>**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**</ins>, is changing the landscape of multiple industries as we know it. AI has saved scientists an immense amount of time in the COVID-19 pandemic, producing a global impact. But what if you **<ins>could</ins> build your own AI** to do your homework, chores, or even just act as a personal companion when you are lonely?

This book is aimed towards **high schoolers** so that **you <ins>can</ins> begin** building your own AI. Most of the important concepts used in AI are based on calculus. **However**, calculus was built on algebra. As a result, this book brings any calculus concepts used in AI down to algebra (more tangible for high schoolers). 

## How can you trust that you are given a legit education on AI? ü§®
1. I have successfully completed Coursera's Machine Learning Course from Stanford University's Stanford Online Program (certificate available for viewing [here](https://coursera.org/share/ad47e4264bf733454b1e37f968d10ebf).
2. I have already taken AP Calculus AB with an exam score of a 5 (with a solid understanding of calculus, I can easily bring calculus concepts used in AI down to algebra).
3. I am a high schooler so I know exactly which math concepts high schoolers know and which math concepts need to be brought down to algebra level.
4. This book is an open source format, meaning...its free! There is no fee to learn! Cancel your commitment anytime!

Details on the structure/format of the book on how to access and run the code is available here (tbd).

## About the Author's Journey in this Field of High Potential
Personally, I got into AI because I thought it was unbelievable how you give the machine an image and it will somehow recognize which objects are presented. Probably the most impressive breakthrough that got me excited about this field is how machines could beat humans in the game Go. How could a machine that spent less time than a human learn the game and learn the strategies beat a champion? 

My dad initiated my journey into AI and I enjoy learning more complex AI and working on AI projects. He works on AI himself by programming physical robots (the ones that move around with a camera and speaker). 

After my sixth grade year he randomly asked me if I wanted to make a website, it was so random I just said ‚Äúok‚Äù because I would actually learn how the ‚Äúcool guys‚Äù (programmers) make websites with code. Not related to AI but that was the first time I got into computer science and started programming.  Later sometime during my junior-high years, I started learning Python. The first time, I quit after a while and then the second time I pushed through. 

Junior high ends and it's the summer of my freshman year at high school. My dad asked me that I should start a project on AI and self-driving cars was my number one pick. The problem was, I did not know anything about making AI so I just went on Github to copy and paste other people‚Äôs work hoping it would work on my side. In reality, it's not that simple, I didn‚Äôt understand much of the README files and their steps so I got a lot of errors. 

Finally, I got one to work somehow but I didn‚Äôt feel that great even though I got the car to detect lane lines. Why? I didn‚Äôt understand what the heck I was doing. It did not feel like a personal achievement, more like cheating on a test and getting a 100. There was no feeling like, ‚ÄúOh YES!! My hard work PAID OFF‚Äù because there was no hard work. I took the shortcut that doesn‚Äôt yield any long-term effects.

Therefore I decided to actually begin learning AI, so I went online and found a 11-week course on Coursera on Machine Learning taught by Andrew Ng, former Stanford University Professor, which I enrolled in mid-August. The course was clearly for calculus students so I struggled with the equations but I persevered and now it has brought me to where I am right now, writing a book for other high schoolers to understand AI without going through a 11-week online class with messy math equations. 

Hopefully you will enjoy this book and save you a lot of time in taking another step into the field of AI. I will try my best to convey the concepts in a different and more relatable way to make understanding as easy as possible. Most importantly, bring calculus back down to algebra (a high schooler‚Äôs math level).
